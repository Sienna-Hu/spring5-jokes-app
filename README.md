# Joke Web Application

This Spring Boot web application displays a random Chuck Norris Joke on the index.

## Detail Description

Following the instructions of an online course about Spring Framework 5 on Udemy, I build this toy web application. It contains a Spring Service Layer (JokeService & JokeServiceimpl), a Spring MVC Controller (JokeController) and a View Layer (insides resources/templates). 

**The building steps go as following**:
1. Create Spring Boot Project from Spring Initializr (add 'Web' and 'Thymeleaf' dependencies)
2. Add new Dependency: group: 'guru.springframework', name: 'chuck-norris-for-actuator', version: '0.0.2'
3. Create Spring Service Layer: 
    1. The Service returns a random joke string from `ChuckNorrisQuotes.getRandomQuote()`
4. Create the Spring MVC Controller: 
    1. Map context root ("/", "") to Jokes view
    2. Add the joke generated by Service to 'joke' property of Model (`model.addAttribute("joke", jokeService.getJoke())`)
    3. Return view name of 'chucknorris'
5. Create the View Layer


## What I learned

Through building this application, I gained some basic understandings of MVC and SpringFramework:
- When the client makes a request (for a webpage here), the Controller gets the Model (through the wired up Service layer) and returns the Model to the View.
